Provisioning these services may be done manually of course, but can also be done automatically through the use of OCI Service Broker.

The default options will work well, as will an Always Free shape if available. Once RUNNING download the DB Connection Wallet and configure secrets as follows:\n  Create oadb-admin secret containing the database administrator password. Used once for schema initializations.\nkubectl create secret generic oadb-admin \\  --namespace mushop \\  --from-literal=oadb_admin_pw=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD\u0026gt;\u0026#39;   Create oadb-wallet secret with the Wallet contents using the downloaded Wallet_*.zip. The extracted Wallet_* directory is specified as the secret file path. Each file will become a key name in the secret data.\nkubectl create secret generic oadb-wallet \\  --namespace mushop \\  --from-file=\u0026lt;PATH_TO_EXTRACTED_WALLET_FOLDER\u0026gt;   Create oadb-connection secret with the Wallet password and the service TNS name to use for connections.\nkubectl create secret generic oadb-connection \\  --namespace mushop \\  --from-literal=oadb_wallet_pw=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;DB_WALLET_PASSWORD\u0026gt;\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=oadb_service=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;DB_TNS_NAME\u0026gt;\u0026#39;  Each database has 5 unique TNS Names displayed when the Wallet is downloaded. For a database named mushopdb an example would be mushopdb_TP.\n     Optional: Instead of creating a shared database for the entire application, you may establish full separation of services by provisioning individual ATP instances for each service that requires a database. To do so, repeat the previous steps for each database,and give each secret a unique name, for example: carts-oadb-admin, carts-oadb-connection, carts-oadb-wallet.\n carts catalogue orders user    Streaming Service   Provision a Streaming instance from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, and make note of the created Stream OCID value. Then create an oss-connection secret containing the Stream connection details.\nkubectl create secret generic oss-connection \\  --namespace mushop \\  --from-literal=streamId=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;STREAM_OCID\u0026gt;\u0026#39; \\  --from-literal=messageEndpoint=\u0026#39;\u0026lt;MESSAGE_ENDPOINT_URL\u0026gt;\u0026#39;   Object Storage   Optional: Provision a Public Object Storage Bucket, and create a Pre-Authenticated Request for the bucket. With the information, create a secret called oos-bucket as follows:\nkubectl create secret generic oos-bucket \\  --namespace mushop \\  --from-literal=region=\u0026lt;BUCKET_REGION\u0026gt; \\  --from-literal=name=\u0026lt;BUCKET_NAME\u0026gt; \\  --from-literal=namespace=\u0026lt;OBJECT_STORAGE_NAMESPACE\u0026gt; \\  --from-literal=parUrl=\u0026lt;PRE_AUTHENTICATED_REQUEST_URL\u0026gt;  Object Storage Namespace may be found with the CLI oci os ns get or from the tenancy information page\n   Verify   Verify the secrets are created and available in the mushop namespace:\nkubectl get secret --namespace mushop NAME TYPE DATA AGE oadb-admin Opaque 1 3m oadb-connection Opaque 2 3m oadb-wallet Opaque 7 3m oci-credentials Opaque 6 3m oos-bucket Opaque 4 3m oss-connection Opaque 2 3m     As an alternative to manually provisioning, the included provision chart is an application of the open-source OCI Service Broker for provisioning Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. This implementation utilizes Open Service Broker in Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes or in other Kubernetes clusters.\ncd deploy/complete/helm-chart dir deploy/complete/helm-chart   The Service Broker for Kubernetes requires access credentials to provision and manage services from within the cluster. Create a secret containing these values as described above. Alternatively, copy the oci-credentials secret to the mushop-utilities namespace:\nkubectl get secret oci-credentials \\  --namespace=mushop \\  --export \\  -o yaml | kubectl apply \\  --namespace=mushop-utilities -f -   Deploy the OCI service broker on your cluster. This is done with the Oracle OCI Service Broker helm chart:\nhelm install \\ https://github.com/oracle/oci-service-broker/releases/download/v1.5.2/oci-service-broker-1.5.2.tgz \\ --namespace mushop-utilities \\ --name oci-broker \\ --set ociCredentials.secretName=oci-credentials \\ --set storage.etcd.useEmbedded=true \\ --set tls.enabled=false helm install oci-broker \\ https://github.com/oracle/oci-service-broker/releases/download/v1.5.2/oci-service-broker-1.5.2.tgz \\ --namespace mushop-utilities \\ --set ociCredentials.secretName=oci-credentials \\ --set storage.etcd.useEmbedded=true \\ --set tls.enabled=false  The above command will deploy the OCI Service Broker using an embedded etcd instance. It is not recommended to deploy the OCI Service Broker using an embedded etcd instance and tls disabled in production environments, instead a separate etcd cluster should be setup and used by the OCI Service Broker.\n Note: For the mushop helm deployment, the OCI Service Broker MUST be installed on the same namespace used by the setup chart. For convenience, the documentation commands defaults both the setup and OCI Service Broker charts to use the mushop-utilities namespace.\n  Next utilize the OCI Service Broker implementation to provision services by installing the included provision chart:\nhelm install provision \\ --namespace mushop \\ --name mushop-provision \\ --set global.osb.compartmentId=\u0026lt;COMPARTMENT_ID\u0026gt; \\ --set global.osb.objectstoragenamespace=\u0026lt;OBJECT_STORAGE_NAMESPACE\u0026gt; helm install mushop-provision provision \\ --namespace mushop \\ --set global.osb.compartmentId=\u0026lt;COMPARTMENT_ID\u0026gt; \\ --set global.osb.objectstoragenamespace=\u0026lt;OBJECT_STORAGE_NAMESPACE\u0026gt;  Object Storage Namespace may be found with the CLI oci os ns get or from the tenancy information page\n   It will take a few minutes for the services database to provision, and the respective bindings to become available. Verify serviceinstances and servicebindings are READY:\nkubectl get serviceinstances -A NAME CLASS PLAN STATUS AGE mushop-atp ClusterServiceClass/atp-service standard Ready 1d mushop-objectstorage ClusterServiceClass/object-store-service standard Ready 1d mushop-oss ClusterServiceClass/oss-service standard Ready 1d kubectl get servicebindings -A NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE SECRET-NAME STATUS AGE mushop-bucket-par-binding mushop-objectstorage mushop-bucket-par-binding Ready 1d mushop-oadb-wallet-binding mushop-atp mushop-oadb-wallet-binding Ready 1d mushop-oss-binding mushop-oss mushop-oss-binding Ready 1d       API Gateway, OCI Functions and Email Delivery Note that this is OPTIONAL. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to configure Email Delivery and deploy a function with API Gateway, skip to the deployment section.\n Configure Email Delivery If you are planning to use the API gateway and Oracle Functions, to send emails using OCI Email Delivery you need to configure an approved sender first.\n From the OCI console, click Email Delivery -\u0026gt; Email Approved Sender Click the Create Approved Sender Enter the email address, for example: mushop@example.com Click Create Approved Sender   Note: if you have your own domain, you can enter a different address (e.g.mushop@[yourdomain.com]) and also configure SPF record for the sender. This involves adding a DNS record to your domain. You can follow these instructions to set up SPF.\n Next, you need to generate the SMTP credentials that will allow you to log in to the SMTP server and send the email. Follow the Generate SMTP Credentails for a User to get the SMTP host, port, username and password.\nThe SMTP credentails (host, port, username and password) and the approved sender email address (e.g. mushop@example.com) will be provided to the function as configuration values later, so make sure you save these values somewhere.\nConfigure function application Each function needs to live inside of an application. You can create a new application either through the console, API or the Fn CLI. An application has a name (e.g. mushop-app) and the VCN and a subnet in which to run the functions. The one guideline here is to pick the subnets that are in the same region as the Docker registry you specified in your context YAML earlier - check these docs for more information.\nThe first step you need to do is to ensure your tenancy is configured for function development. You can follow the Configuring Your Tenancy for Function Development documentation.\nAs a next step you will need to install the Fn CLI. If on a Mac and you\u0026rsquo;re using Brew, you can run:\nbrew install fn Finally, you will need configure the Fn CLI - you can follow these instructions that will guide you through creating a context file and configuring it with an image registry.\nTo create an application using Fn CLI, run:\nfn create app [APP_NAME] --annotation oracle.com/oci/subnetIds=\u0026#39;[\u0026#34;ocid1.subnet.oc1.iad....\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;  Note: make sure you replace APP_NAME and the ocid1.subnet with actual values\n Deploy and configure the function To deploy a function to an app, you can run the following command within the function folder (/src/functions/newsletter-subscription):\nfn deploy --app [APP_NAME]  Note: use fn -v deploy --app [APP_NAME] to get verbose output in case you\u0026rsquo;re running into issues.\n In the remainder of the document, we will use mushop-app for the application name.\nYou need to provide additional configuration (SMTP credentails) for the function to work properly and be able to send emails.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully deployed the function, you can use the Fn CLI to add configuration values (note that you can also do the same through the Console UI).\nRun the following commands to configure SMTP settings and the approved sender (replace the values):\nfn config function mushop-app newsletter-subscription SMTP_USER \u0026lt;smtp_username\u0026gt; fn config function mushop-app newsletter-subscription SMTP_PASSWORD \u0026lt;smtp_password\u0026gt; fn config function mushop-app newsletter-subscription SMTP_HOST \u0026lt;smtp_host\u0026gt; fn config function mushop-app newsletter-subscription SMTP_PORT \u0026lt;smtp_port\u0026gt; fn config function mushop-app newsletter-subscription APPROVED_SENDER_EMAIL \u0026lt;approved_sender_email\u0026gt; Creating an API gateway You will be using an API Gateway to access the functions. To prepare your tenancy for using the gateway, check the Preparing for API Gateway documentation.\nThe quickest way to create a gateway is through the OCI console:\n Click Developer Services -\u0026gt; API Gateway from the sidebar on the left Click the Create Gateway button Enter the following values (you can use a different name if you\u0026rsquo;d like):  Name: mushop-gateway Type: Public Virtual Cloud Network: Pick one from the dropdown Subnet: Pick the subnet from the dropdown   Click Create When gateway is created, click the Deployments link from the sidebar on the left Under the Deployments, click the Create Deployment button Make sure From Scratch option is selected at the top and enter the following values (you can leave the other values as they are - i.e. no need to enable CORS, Authentication or Rate Limiting):  Name: newsletter-subscription Path prefix: /newsletter Compartment: \u0026lt; Pick your compartment \u0026gt; Execution log: Enabled Log level: Error   Click Next to define the route Enter the following values for Route 1:  Path: /subscribe Methods: POST Type: Oracle Functions Application: mushop-app (or other, if you used a different name) Function name: newsletter-subscription   Click the Show Route Logging Policies link and enable Execution Log Click Next and review the deployment Click Create to create the gateway deployment  When deployment completes, navigate to it to get the URL for the gateway. Click the Show link next to the Endpoint label to reveal the full URL for the deployment. It should look like this:\nhttps://aaaaaaaaa.apigateway.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/newsletter/subscribe You will use this URL in values-dev.yaml when creating the deployment.\nDeployment Having completed the provisioning steps above, the mushop deployment helm chart is installed using settings to leverage cloud backing services.\nConfiguration   Make a copy of the values-dev.yaml file and store somewhere on your machine as myvalues.yaml. Then complete the missing values (e.g. secret names) like the following:\nglobal:ociAuthSecret:oci-credentials # OCI authentication credentials secretossStreamSecret:oss-connection # Name of Stream connection secretoadbAdminSecret:oadb-admin # Name of DB Admin secretoadbWalletSecret:oadb-wallet # Name of Wallet secretoadbConnectionSecret:oadb-connection# Name of DB Connection secretoosBucketSecret:oos-bucket # Object storage bucket secret name (optional) NOTE: If it\u0026rsquo;s desired to connect a separate databases for a given service, you can specify values specific for each service, such as carts.oadbAdminSecret, carts.oadbWalletSecret\u0026hellip;\n Database (oadb-*), stream (oss-*), and bucket (oos-*) secrets may be omitted if using the automated service broker approach.\n   Optional: If an Object Storage bucket is provisioned, you can configure the api environment to use the object URL prefix in myvalues.yaml:\napi:env:mediaUrl:# https://objectstorage.[REGION].oraclecloud.com/n/[NAMESPACE]/b/[BUCKET_NAME]/o/  Optional: If you configured the Email Delivery, API gateway and the function, add the following snippet to your myvalues.yaml file:\napi:env:mediaUrl:# ...newsletterSubscribeUrl:https://[API_GATEWAY_URL]  Installation   Install the mushop application helm chart using the myvalues.yaml created above:\n  OPTION 1: With cloud services provisioned manually:\nhelm install ./mushop \\ --name mushop \\ --namespace mushop \\ --values myvalues.yaml helm install mushop ./mushop \\ --namespace mushop \\ --values myvalues.yaml   OPTION 2: When using OCI Service Broker (provision chart):\nhelm install ./mushop \\ --name mushop \\ --namespace mushop \\ --set global.osb.atp=true \\ --set global.osb.oss=true \\ --set global.osb.objectstorage=true \\ --values myvalues.yaml helm install mushop ./mushop \\ --namespace mushop \\ --set global.osb.atp=true \\ --set global.osb.oss=true \\ --set global.osb.objectstorage=true \\ --values myvalues.yaml     Wait for deployment pods to be RUNNING and init pods to show COMPLETED:\nkubectl get pods --namespace mushop --watch NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE mushop-api-769c4d9fd8-hp7mc 1/1 Running 0 31s mushop-assets-dd5756599-pxngg 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-assets-deploy-1-n2bk6 0/1 Completed 0 33s mushop-carts-6f5db9565f-4w65t 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-carts-init-1-dcs82 0/1 Completed 0 33s mushop-catalogue-76977479fd-thdq4 1/1 Running 0 32s mushop-catalogue-init-1-twx9x 0/1 Completed 0 33s mushop-edge-648c989cd4-6g9dk 1/1 Running 0 32s mushop-events-569f4744c9-l7pqt 1/1 Running 0 30s mushop-fulfillment-85489cd99b-lzwqp 1/1 Running 0 30s mushop-nats-84dc5db659-7rpbl 1/1 Running 0 32s mushop-orders-6dcc7bbbb6-658tq 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-orders-init-1-tm8ls 0/1 Completed 0 33s mushop-payment-c7dccd8cc-t9wmj 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-session-5ff4c9557f-dmbq8 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-storefront-8656597656-lgdlk 1/1 Running 0 33s mushop-user-54f4978d68-qhr7n 0/1 Running 0 31s mushop-user-init-1-8k62c 0/1 Completed 0 33s  Note: if you installed Istio service mesh, you should see 2/2 in the READY column and 1/2 for the init pods and the assets deploy pod.

	"content": "Note that this is OPTIONAL. This section is only applicable if you have completed Istio service mesh section.\n Introduction In this section we will demonstrate canary deployment use case with MuShop Application.\nOne of the benefits of the Istio project is that it provides the control needed to deploy canary services. The idea behind canary deployment (or rollout) is to introduce a new version of a service by first testing it using a small percentage of user traffic, and then if all goes well, increase, possibly gradually in increments, the percentage while simultaneously phasing out the old version. If anything goes wrong along the way, we abort and rollback to the previous version. In its simplest form, the traffic sent to the canary version is a randomly selected percentage of requests, but in more sophisticated schemes it can be based on the region, user, or other properties of the request. Read more details here\nWe shall demonstrate the simplest canary deployment by using two versions of storefront microservice (storefront:original and storefront:beta) and would split traffic between the two.\n storefront:original would be the original page which does not have the reviews feature. storefront:beta would have a new feature called \u0026ldquo;reviews\u0026rdquo; displayed on the UI which would let the user\u0026rsquo;s provide review for their products.  Note: The builds storefront:original and storefront:beta naming conventions are used here for easier understanding. Later during the procedure we will use the exact build version.\nLets look at the diagram which would explain the same\nThe path between users and storefront has many layers ( DNS -\u0026gt; WAF -\u0026gt; LB -\u0026gt; INGRESS -\u0026gt; Router -\u0026gt; Storefront), The above figure shown is high level. Refer https://mushop.ateam.cloud/about.html for more details.\n We would configure and run the storefront services in an Istio-enabled environment, with Envoy sidecars injected along side each service. We configure the Istio http routing by creating a VirtualService and Destination rules. Storefront images are available on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry. We would use them to create a kubernetes deployment.\nPre-Requisites Deploy Mushop\nDownload and install Istio Service Mesh\nDeploy storefront beta   Create a deployment with the below config and name it mushop-storefrontv2.\nNote: We will use the same labels as that of storefront original.\n  cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront name: mushop-storefrontv2 namespace: mushop spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: storefront app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront template: metadata: labels: app: storefront app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront version: 2.1.3-beta.1 spec: containers: - image: iad.ocir.io/oracle/ateam/mushop-storefront:2.1.3-beta.1 imagePullPolicy: Always name: storefront EOF \u0026quot;apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront name: mushop-storefrontv2 namespace: mushop spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: storefront app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront template: metadata: labels: app: storefront app.kubernetes.io/instance: mushop app.kubernetes.io/name: storefront version: 2.1.3-beta.1 spec: containers: - image: iad.ocir.io/oracle/ateam/mushop-storefront:2.1.3-beta.1 imagePullPolicy: Always name: storefront\u0026quot; | kubectl apply -f - Create Istio resources   Deploy a Gateway resource\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: Gateway metadata: name: gateway namespace: mushop spec: selector: istio: ingressgateway servers: - port: number: 80 name: http protocol: HTTP hosts: - '*' EOF \u0026quot;apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: Gateway metadata: name: gateway namespace: mushop spec: selector: istio: ingressgateway servers: - port: number: 80 name: http protocol: HTTP hosts: - '*'\u0026quot; | kubectl apply -f -   Deploy a VirtualService and DestinationRules\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService metadata: name: edge namespace: mushop spec: hosts: - '*' gateways: - gateway http: - match: - uri: prefix: /api route: - destination: host: mushop-api.mushop.svc.cluster.local - match: - uri: prefix: /assets rewrite: uri: / route: - destination: host: mushop-assets.mushop.svc.cluster.local - route: - destination: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subset: original weight: 50 - destination: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subset: beta weight: 50 EOF \u0026quot;apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: VirtualService metadata: name: edge namespace: mushop spec: hosts: - '*' gateways: - gateway http: - match: - uri: prefix: /api route: - destination: host: mushop-api.mushop.svc.cluster.local - match: - uri: prefix: /assets rewrite: uri: / route: - destination: host: mushop-assets.mushop.svc.cluster.local - route: - destination: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subset: original weight: 50 - destination: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subset: beta weight: 50 | kubectl apply -f -  Destination Rule  cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | k apply -f - apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: reviews-destination spec: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subsets: - name: original labels: version: 2.1.2 - name: beta labels: version: 2.1.3-beta.1 EOF \u0026quot;apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind: DestinationRule metadata: name: reviews-destination spec: host: mushop-storefront.mushop.svc.cluster.local subsets: - name: original labels: version: 2.1.2 - name: beta labels: version: 2.1.3-beta.1\u0026quot; | kubectl apply -f -   Open a browser with the EXTERNAL-IP of the Istio ingress gateway\nkubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway \\  --namespace istio-system  Locating EXTERNAL-IP for Istio Ingress Gateway.

	"content": "Introduction In this section we will demonstrate how to run leverage your kubernetes cluster for CI/CD tasks using Jenkins.\nNote that Jenkins is OPTIONAL and disabled by default. To enable it, see setup section.\n When enabled, a Jenkins server is installed on the kubernetes cluster and is setup to utilize the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin. The plugin enables Jenkins to create worker nodes on demand as pods on the kubernetes cluster to run jobs, then terminates the pods when the job is completed. This also lets the system run any arbitrary job since all job related dependencies (say, building an application that requires a specific version of java) are contained within the definition of a docker container that executes the step.\nMore information on the kubernetes plugin and the extensions it provides for the Jenkins pipeline are described here\nAccessing Jenkins Once installation is completed, you can access the Jenkins server using the ingress controller (if one was configured), or using a port forward.\nTo use the ingress, first find the external IP for the Load Balancer that was created :\nkubectl get svc mushop-utils-ingress-nginx-controller \\  --namespace mushop-utilities Ensure that Jenkins is up and ready\nkubectl get deployment -n mushop-utilities mushop-utils-jenkins Once Jenkins is ready, navigate to http:///jenkins\nThe default username is admin. The default password is generated and stored as a kubernetes secret.\nkubectl get secret -n mushop-utilities mushop-utils-jenkins \\ -o jsonpath=\u0026#34;{.data.jenkins-admin-password}\u0026#34; | base64 --decode ; echo A simple build job Once logged in, we can test a simple pipeline by creating a multi-branch pipeline based on the repository\nhttps://github.com/jeevanjoseph/jenkins-k8s-pipeline.git\nThe repository contains a Jenkinsfile that describes how it should be built and this is the only information that Jenkins requires in order to run the build. In this example, the build defines its execution environment to include a terraform container to run terraform code, and a docker container to build docker images.\n"

Setup service connector between OCI logging and OCI monitoring with a new custom monitoring namespace. Simulated the payment failures on MuShop application.  Using the OCI console Logging -\u0026gt; Agent Configurations we configured the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes(OKE) worker nodes to send all the pod logs to OCI logging. Service connector helped to filter just the MuShop payment failures messages and send those logs onto OCI Monitoring which then helped us to view the metrics on a dashboard. We set alarm for that metric to get alerts on our email. We also, analyzed the logs using the OCI console Logging -\u0026gt; Search to root cause the issue which was \u0026ldquo;Payment above 105 were getting declined\u0026rdquo;.\n"
