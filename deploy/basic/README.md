This is a Terraform configuration that deploys the MuShop basic sample application on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)][oci].

MuShop basic is a 3-tier web application that implements an e-commerce site. 
It is built to showcase the features of [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)][oci].
This application is designed to run using only the Always Free tier resources. 
The repository contains the application code as well as the [Terraform][tf] code to create a [Resource Manager][orm] stack, 
that creates all the required resources and configures the application on the created resources.

## Topology

The application uses a typical topology for a 3-tier web application as follows

Being private, they ensure that the application nodes are not exposed to the internet                                                                                       | [Learn More][vcn]     |

Components in this subnet can be allocated public IP addresses and be exposed to the internet through the InternetGateway.                                                            | [Learn More][vcn]     |

| Security Lists        | Security Lists act like a firewall with the rules determining what type of traffic is allowed in or out.       | Security rules enable HTTP traffic to the LoadBalancer from anywhere. Also enables are HTTP and SSH traffic to the compute instances, but only from the subnet where the load balancer is.                                             | [Learn More][seclist] |

## Build

- Clone https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-cloudnative
- From the root of the repo execute the command:
  
 `docker build -t mushop-basic -f deploy/basic/Dockerfile .`

- Generate Stack Zip Package for OCI Resource Manager

`docker run -v $PWD:/transfer --rm --entrypoint cp mushop-basic:latest /package/mushop-basic-stack.zip /transfer/mushop-basic-stack.zip`

or under windows powershell:

`docker run -v "$((pwd).path -replace '\\', '/'):/transfer" --rm --entrypoint cp mushop-basic:latest /package/mushop-basic-stack.zip /transfer/mushop-basic-stack.zip`

This creates a `.zip` file in your working directory that can be imported in to OCI Resource Manager.
